# Chess-data-analysis
Creating and visualizing graphs with Neo4j and Gephi to extract relevant information
(The project's report and presentation are written in french)

We used databases from https://database.lichess.org/
The objective of this project is to build knowledge graphs from these databases
and deduce improvement strategies for beginner players.

We used a Python script to extract relevant information from the downloaded (.PNG) files to .CSV files
Then we used Cypher queries in Neo4J to construct our knowledge graph
And finally we used Gephi to have better visualizations and have the desired information
