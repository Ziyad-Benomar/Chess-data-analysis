# Chess-data-analysis
(March - June 2020)  
Creating and visualizing graphs with Neo4j and Gephi to extract relevant information from a chess databasse
(The project's report and presentation are written in french)

We used databases from https://database.lichess.org/
The objective is to deduce improvement strategies and advice for beginner players.

In this project, we will
- manipulate graphs: create, modify, add connections
- query them by the properties of the nodes, or by the paths ...
- visualize them, analyze connectivity, related components ...
- reason in knowledge graphs



We used a Python script to extract relevant information from the downloaded (.PNG) files to .CSV files
Then we used Cypher queries in Neo4J to construct our knowledge graph
And finally we used Gephi to have better visualizations and have the desired information
